        I have had a career in tech for 6 years starting in sales and then
        project management. I am passionate about coming up with innovative,
        fast, concise, user friendly solutions to problems. My previous job was
        at a company where we built websites and I constantly kept saying to
        myself “there has got to be a better way to do this” and that led me to
        pursue software development. I wanted to have the skills to develop
        technology and then improve upon that technology. I am geared towards
        troubleshooting, problem solving, and collaborating in order to improve
        solutions. I also enjoy faster paced careers that combine my interest in
        learning new skills and improving customer experience. Even as a server
        in the food industry, I was motivated by the fast moving culture and
        providing the best customer service possible. This carried over into my
        sales career, and then as a project manager. During my sales career, I
        was able to gain a unique perspective in the cost of building out a data
        center and running a company, as far as technologically, and thus I
        understand the value of efficient, dry code. I look forward to combining
        these skills as a software engineer.
